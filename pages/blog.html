	IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON OUR DAILY LIFE 
	</b>
</h2>	
	<p style="margin: 20px;">
		Technology has introduced various useful devices and assets, putting valuable data readily available. There are such a large number of new technologies in use which are all intended to make our life simpler. Technology is developing at a really quick pace in the recent world so it's not possible to ignore the impact of technology on our daily lives. If we observe the environment around us, all we see is the use of various technologies.Perhaps the best way to look at technology is in terms of progress.The world basically shows signs of improvement since innovation has created high standard of living.We are able to use different types of technologies in this present world which has made our living simpler. But if observe more about technology we can find both positive and negative impacts of technology.At the side of several benefits, it has also provided us in each field with plenty of negative effects.    	
	</p> <br><br>
<p>      
	In my life technology has helped me in almost all of my activities. It has been my support for all of my works. From waking up at the morning the use of technology starts in my life. It has always been useful and but it also have some negative effects from my perspective. Not exactly the technology but the process of using these technologies has created a negative side of technology.The way we use technology determines if its impacts are truely positive or negative to the society. <br><br>Following are the positive and negative impact of technology in  my life:

	Positive Impact of Technology:
		</h3>
	
		<ol type="a">
			<li><b>
				Communication:</b>
			</li><br><p><br> 
			Technology has improved communication. When it comes to the way we communicate in todays world innovation has had an amazing impact. Communication is used for a number of purposes. We all depend on communication to transfer information.And,we all use technology to communicate with each other. Electronic media like internet, social media have been the most useful way for me to exchange ideas with my freinds and family. Some of these communication technologies like Televisions, radios, and internet are used to persuade, entertain and inform the society. Any kind of solution for different problems is found using different devicess. The internet and mobile communication technology has become the most supportive technology for communication in my daily life.</p><br><br><br><br>	
			<li><b>
				Transportation:</b>
				
			</li><br><p><br> 
			Technology has improved transportation. Transportation is one of the basic areas of technological activity. Both society and businesses have benefited from the new transpiration methods. Transportation provides mobility for people and goods. Transportation, like all other technologies, can be viewed as a system. It is a series of parts that are interrelated. These parts all work together to meet a certain goal. Transportation uses vehicles, trains, airplanes, motorbikes, people, roads, energy, information, materials, finance and time. All these parts I have mentioned work together to move and relocate people and goods.Technologies like automobiles, buses, etc. has become the most  easier method for travelling for me. These transportation technologies have improved the way humans move and how they transport their goods from place to another.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
			<li><b>
				Education:</b>
				
			</li><br> 	<p><br> 
			Technology has improved education and learning process. Education is the backbone of every economy. People need well and organized educational infrastructures so that they can learn how to interpret information. Being a student I have met with various problems while working with my studies. And, mobile technology has always helped me in this field. With the use of internet I am able to research for all of my problems and able to find the solutions for each problem.  Also my school and college are able to use  educational technologies and maintained a great aim of improving the way students learn. Technologies like smart whiteboards, computers, mobile phones, iPads, projectors, and internet are being used in classrooms to boost students moral to learn. Visual education is becoming more popular and it has proved to be the best method of learning in many subjects.</p><br><br><br>

	Negative Impact of Technology:
		</h4><br><br><br><br>
	<br><br>s
	<ol type="a">
			<li><b>
				Increased Pollution:</b>
			</li><br><p><br> Pollution affects the land we grow crops on, the water we drink and the air we breathe. The increased demand for new technologies and advancement of technologies has resulted in many manufacturing and processing factories. From what i have seen various work are conducted  to create the best technologies for both society and business, they release harmful chemicals and gasses which have polluted our environment and this has resulted in climate changes (global warming).Also, the waste products from the factories are also not dumped in proper place which has affected the environment. So the more technology we enjoy, the more we harm our environment.</p><br><br><br><br>	

			<li><b>
				Addiction</b>
				
			</li><br> 	<p><br> 
			Addiction towards technology has been the major problem in today's world and is affecting millions of people around the world. It has also been harming the mental heath condition of peoples. Although technology has a lot of benefits using any device for a long time surely will harm us. In my life I fear teachnology when I excessively use  mobile phones for entertainment purposes like playing video games etc.  Sleep disorder, severe headache, weak eye sight may be the common problem of excessive use of these devices. Also,these addiction tends to make oneself moody , irritable, depressed, and also physically aggressive. Some people who usually spend hours dealing with TVs and Computers without interacting with people get discouraged and get an independent behavior which results in fear of talking to people resulting them to suffer from mental disease called anxiety.
